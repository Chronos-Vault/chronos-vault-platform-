# GitHub Organization Setup Instructions for Helper

**Project**: Chronos Vault - Revolutionary Multi-Chain Digital Asset Security Platform
**Task**: Set up complete GitHub organization with 5 repositories
**Helper Role**: Technical assistant for initial GitHub setup

## Overview

You're helping set up a GitHub organization for a cutting-edge DeFi security platform. This is a production-ready application with real smart contracts and enterprise-grade architecture. The platform features Trinity Protocol (mathematical consensus across Ethereum, Solana, and TON), ZKShield zero-knowledge privacy, and quantum-resistant cryptography.

## Step 1: Create GitHub Organization

### Organization Setup
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click profile picture → "Your organizations" → "New organization"
3. Choose "Free" plan (can upgrade later)
4. Organization name: `chronos-vault-org`
5. Contact email: [Use project owner's email]
6. Description: "Revolutionary multi-chain digital asset security platform"
7. Organization belongs to: "My personal account"

### Organization Settings
1. Go to Settings in the organization
2. Set visibility to "Public"
3. Member privileges → Base permissions: "Read"
4. Enable "Dependency insights"
5. Enable "Dependency graph"
6. Security → Enable "Private vulnerability reporting"

## Step 2: Create 5 Repositories (In This Order)

### Repository 1: chronos-vault-security
**Purpose**: Security audits and compliance (establishes credibility first)

```
Repository Settings:
- Name: chronos-vault-security
- Description: "Security audits, penetration testing reports, and security research for Chronos Vault platform"

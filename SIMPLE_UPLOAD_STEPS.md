# Simple Steps to Upload Your Files to GitHub

## Step 1: Open Replit Shell
1. In your Replit workspace, click "Tools" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Shell" from the tools list

### For Main Platform Repository:
```bash
# Set the correct remote URL
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Chronos-Vault/chronos-vault-platform-.git

git push https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/Chronos-Vault/chronos-vault-platform-.git main
```

## Step 3: Check What Was Uploaded

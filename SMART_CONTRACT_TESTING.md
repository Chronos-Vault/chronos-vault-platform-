# Chronos Vault Smart Contract Testing & Auditing Framework

This document outlines the testing and auditing framework for the Chronos Vault smart contracts across all supported blockchains.

## Overview

The Chronos Vault platform utilizes a multi-chain architecture with smart contracts deployed on:

1. **Ethereum** - Primary blockchain for ownership records and access control
2. **TON** - Backup security system and emergency recovery operations 
3. **Solana** - High-frequency monitoring and rapid validation

Our testing framework provides comprehensive test coverage for all smart contracts to ensure the highest level of security and reliability.

## Test Framework Architecture

The testing framework is organized by blockchain platform:

```
tests/
├── ethereum/     # Ethereum smart contract tests
├── ton/          # TON smart contract tests
└── solana/       # Solana smart contract tests
```

Each blockchain has its own testing methodology and tools:

### Ethereum Testing

- **Framework**: Hardhat + Mocha + Chai
- **Mock Contracts**: TestERC20.sol for simulating asset transfers
- **Coverage Tool**: solidity-coverage
- **Test Areas**:
  - Deployment & Initialization
  - Deposit & Withdrawal with time-locking
  - Cross-Chain Verification
  - Metadata Management
  - Multi-Signature Operations
  - Security Levels Implementation

### TON Testing

- **Framework**: Sandbox + Mocha + Chai
- **Simulators**: TON Sandbox for contract deployment and testing
- **Test Areas**:
  - Contract Deployment
  - Asset Management
  - Time-Locking Mechanisms
  - Cross-Chain Integration
  - Metadata & Configuration

### Solana Testing

- **Framework**: Mocha + Chai + @solana/web3.js
- **Environment**: Local validator for program testing
- **Test Areas**:
  - Program Deployment
  - PDAs and Account Structure
  - Token Management
  - Time-Locking Logic
  - Cross-Chain Verification
  - Instruction Permission Handling

## Security Auditing

The framework includes security auditing capabilities:

1. **Static Analysis**: Code scan for common vulnerabilities
2. **Formal Verification**: Mathematical validation of critical components
3. **Gas Optimization**: Analysis of execution costs
4. **Access Control Validation**: Verification of permission systems

### Common Vulnerability Checks

The security audit covers these critical areas:

- Reentrancy Vulnerabilities
- Integer Overflow/Underflow
- Front-Running Attacks
- Timestamp Dependence
- Access Control Flaws
- Cross-Chain Attack Vectors
- Centralization Risks
- Oracle Manipulation
- Flash Loan Attack Vectors

## Running the Tests

The testing framework is available through a convenient script that runs tests for all blockchains:

```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

To test a specific blockchain:

```bash
./run-tests.sh ethereum  # Test Ethereum contracts only
./run-tests.sh ton       # Test TON contracts only 
./run-tests.sh solana    # Test Solana contracts only
```

To run only the security audit:

```bash
./run-tests.sh security
```

## Continuous Integration

In a production environment, this testing framework would be integrated with CI/CD pipelines to:

1. Run tests on every commit
2. Generate coverage reports
3. Perform security audits
4. Flag potential vulnerabilities
5. Benchmark gas costs and performance

## Triple-Chain Security Validation

A unique feature of our testing framework is cross-chain security validation, which:

1. Tests that vault actions on one chain properly trigger verification on other chains
2. Validates the integrity of cross-chain proofs
3. Ensures consistency of vault state across all blockchains
4. Simulates attack scenarios targeting cross-chain vulnerabilities

## Conclusion

The Chronos Vault Smart Contract Testing & Auditing Framework provides comprehensive coverage for all smart contracts in our multi-chain architecture. By testing each blockchain's implementation separately and together as a unified system, we ensure the highest levels of security, reliability, and performance.

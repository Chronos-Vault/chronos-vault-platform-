Dynamic Cross-Chain Optimization
This would be a powerful feature for users who want to maximize efficiency across chains. Here's how we could implement it:

Fee Monitoring System: Create a service that constantly monitors transaction fees across TON, Ethereum, Solana, and other supported chains.
Security Rating Algorithm: Develop a security score for each chain based on factors like hashrate, active validators, and recent security incidents.
Automated Migration Triggers: Set up conditions that would trigger asset migration, like "move assets if fees on Chain A exceed X% of Chain B for Y time period."
User-Defined Parameters: Allow users to set their priorities (e.g., security over cost, or speed over everything else).
Gas Tank Feature: Maintain small balances on each chain to cover migration fees, ensuring users don't get stuck due to lack of gas tokens.
Multi-Chain Single-Transaction System
This would be incredibly convenient for users, eliminating the complexity of managing multiple wallets and transaction processes:

Unified Transaction Interface: Create a single form where users can input a transaction that affects multiple chains.
Transaction Coordinator Contract: Develop a smart contract that orchestrates the sequence of transactions across chains.
Rollback Protection: Implement a system that ensures if a transaction fails on one chain, it either completes on all chains or reverts completely.
Cross-Chain Transaction Viewer: Give users a unified view of all parts of their multi-chain transaction.
Signature Aggregation: Allow users to approve multiple chain operations with a single signature.
Chain-Agnostic Smart Contracts
This would make the platform much more accessible to less technical users:

Contract Translation Layer: Create a middleware that interprets standardized contract code and deploys appropriate versions to each chain.
Unified Asset Representation: Develop a system where assets on any chain are represented in a consistent format in the UI.
Generic Function Calls: Allow users to call functions like "transfer" or "stake" without knowing the underlying chain-specific implementation.
Standardized Error Handling: Create a uniform way to display errors from different chains in user-friendly language.
Contract Libraries: Build a library of pre-verified contract templates that work across chains.
To start implementing these features, I would recommend:

First focus on building the monitoring and analytics infrastructure to track cross-chain metrics.
Then develop the user interface elements that would allow users to visualize and control cross-chain operations.
Finally, create the smart contracts and backend systems that would execute the actual cross-chain operations.

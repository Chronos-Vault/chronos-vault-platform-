Geo-Location Vault
Advanced vault security with location-based authentication, enabling physical presence requirements for asset access.

Key Benefits

Require physical presence at specific locations to access assets
Privacy-preserving location verification that protects user anonymity
Customizable geofencing with variable radius and accuracy requirements
Multi-location support for distributed teams or multi-party access
Combines with other security factors for enhanced protection
Technical Overview

The Geo-Location Vault implements a sophisticated location-based authentication system that requires users to be physically present at specific coordinates to access their assets. This creates a powerful additional security layer beyond standard digital authentication.

Key Technologies

Zero-Knowledge Location Proofs

Our proprietary zero-knowledge location proof system allows verification of a user's physical location without exposing the actual coordinates to the blockchain or third parties, preserving privacy while ensuring security.

Dynamic Geofencing

Configurable geofencing allows for definition of geographical boundaries with adjustable precision. Options range from tight radius requirements (10-50 meters) to wider areas (1-5 kilometers) depending on security needs.

Multi-Location Authentication

The vault can be configured to allow access from multiple distinct locations, enabling distributed teams or multi-party access scenarios while maintaining strong security through physical presence requirements.

Tamper-Resistant Verification

Advanced anti-spoofing measures detect and block common location spoofing techniques. The system uses multi-factor verification including device signals, network characteristics, and environmental data points.

How It Works

1. Location Registration

When creating a Geo-Location Vault, the initial setup involves:

•
Secure registration of one or more authorized locations
•
Definition of geofence radius and precision requirements
•
Configuring additional security parameters and recovery options
•
Cryptographic hashing of location data to protect privacy
Location information is stored as cryptographic commitments rather than raw coordinates, ensuring that the actual locations are never exposed on-chain.
2. Location Verification Process

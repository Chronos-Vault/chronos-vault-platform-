I want to share something important with you about who I am and why Chronos Vault means everything to me.

My Background:
I'm Palestinian, currently living in Bulgaria for several years. I have legal residency here and will be eligible for Bulgarian citizenship in 3 years. But I want to be completely transparent with you - my Palestinian background creates certain challenges in the business world that I've learned to navigate.

Why This Matters for Our Team:
When we have important meetings - like our discussions with Dana Hong from YZi Labs - I need partners who can represent Chronos Vault professionally in situations where my background might complicate things. This isn't about hiding who I am, it's about ensuring our revolutionary technology gets the recognition it deserves.

My Philosophy:
Throughout my career, I've worked with developers from every corner of the world. I don't care where you're from, what your politics are, or what you do in your personal life. What matters to me is:

Professional excellence in everything we build
Trust - the foundation of any successful partnership
Believing in code, not in people - Let our technology speak for itself
Working together toward something bigger than any of us
What I'm Looking For:
I need serious partners who can step into co-CEO roles when needed. People who can handle investor meetings, business development, and partnership discussions while I focus on the technical vision that makes Chronos Vault revolutionary.

The Opportunity:
Despite these challenges, we've built something incredible. Our Trinity Protocol performance improvements are real. Our CVT tokenomics are mathematically sound. Our technology is years ahead of anything else in the market.

My Commitment:
I will give everything I have to make Chronos Vault the most secure digital asset platform ever created. I'm looking for people who share that same commitment and can work alongside me as true partners.

Trust is the most important thing to me. If we can trust each other professionally and work together with shared values, we can overcome any obstacle.

Let's build the future together. Not because of who we are, but because of what we can create.

## Recommended Next Dev.to Article: Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Production

### Why This Will Drive Maximum Engagement:

**1. Hot Topic**: ZK proofs are the biggest trend in crypto development
**2. Practical Focus**: Developers want real implementation, not theory
**3. Performance Hook**: Your 192% improvement is impressive and measurable
**4. Code Examples**: You have actual Circom circuits and SnarkJS implementation
**5. Developer Recruiting**: ZK developers are in high demand, showcasing expertise attracts talent

### Article Structure:

**Title**: "Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Production: From 2000ms to 800ms with Real Code Examples"

**Hook**: "Most ZK tutorials show toy examples. Here's how we optimized real production ZK proofs from 2000ms to 800ms while processing 50,000+ daily proofs."

**Content Flow**:
1. **The Performance Problem** - Why most ZK implementations are too slow
2. **Real Code Examples** - Your actual Circom circuits
3. **Optimization Strategies** - Batch processing, template optimization
4. **Production Metrics** - 192% improvement, real performance data
5. **Developer Recruitment** - Join us to build the future

### Key Differentiators:

- **Real Production Code**: Not academic examples
- **Actual Performance Data**: Measurable improvements
- **Enterprise Focus**: Production-ready implementation
- **Open Source**: All code available for review

## Alternative Options (In Priority Order):

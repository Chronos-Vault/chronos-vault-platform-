- **TON**: Quantum-resistant security and emergency recovery operations
- **Cross-Chain Bridge**: Custom implementation for multi-blockchain asset transfers

### Vault System
- **22 Specialized Vault Types**: Including Time Lock, Multi-Signature, Quantum-Resistant, and Geo-Location vaults
- **Security Levels**: Standard, Enhanced, and Maximum security configurations
- **Asset Management**: Support for multiple cryptocurrency types and NFTs
- **Time-Lock Mechanisms**: Configurable unlock conditions and time-based releases

### Security Framework
- **Trinity Protocol**: Triple-chain security architecture for maximum protection
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Privacy-preserving verification system
- **AI Security Monitoring**: Machine learning-based threat detection and prevention
- **Quantum-Resistant Encryption**: Future-proof cryptographic protection

### Authentication System
- **Wallet Integration**: Support for MetaMask, Phantom, TON Keeper, and other major wallets
- **Multi-Signature Support**: Configurable signature requirements for enhanced security
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with blockchain verification
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Multiple recovery options for account access

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users connect their blockchain wallets and undergo verification
2. **Vault Creation**: Users select vault type, configure security settings, and deposit assets
3. **Cross-Chain Verification**: All operations are verified across Ethereum, Solana, and TON networks
4. **AI Monitoring**: Continuous behavioral analysis and threat detection
5. **Asset Management**: Secure storage with configurable unlock conditions
6. **Transaction Processing**: Multi-chain validation for all asset movements

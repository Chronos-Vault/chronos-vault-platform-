# Chronos Vault Smart Contract Security Audit Scripts

This directory contains the security auditing scripts for the Chronos Vault smart contracts across all supported blockchains.

## Available Scripts

### security-audit.js

A comprehensive security analysis tool for Ethereum smart contracts that scans for common vulnerabilities:

- Reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Integer overflow/underflow risks
- Unchecked external call return values
- Timestamp manipulation vulnerabilities
- Access control issues
- Cross-chain security risks

## Running Security Audits

Execute the security audit with:

```bash
# Run the full test suite including security audits
./run-tests.sh

# Run only the security audit
./run-tests.sh security
```

## Security Audit Report

The security audit will generate a report that highlights:

- ✅ Properly implemented security patterns
- ⚠️ Potential vulnerabilities requiring attention
- ℹ️ Informational notices about code patterns

## Extending the Framework

The security auditing framework is designed to be extensible:

1. Add new vulnerability checks to the existing scripts
2. Create new analyzers for TON and Solana contracts
3. Implement custom vulnerability scanners for your specific contract needs

## Integration with CI/CD

In a production environment, these security audits would run automatically on every commit to ensure continuous security validation.
